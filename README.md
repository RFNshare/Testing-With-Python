# Web-Automation-With-Python

A place for me to write down all of the little things I learn every day. This serves largely as a way for me to remember
little things I'd otherwise have to keep looking up.

Many of these will be technical. Many of these will not.

Behold my periodic learnings, and judge me for my ignorance.

## Tech and Team

"Worky" things. Mostly (or entirely) technical related to API Automation with python learnings.

### Python Basic

* Basics of python language.
* Datatypes & Variables
* Flow Control & OOP
* Read & Write
* Exception Handling Mechanism

### Web Automation Basic

* Usage of Python selenium library
* Execute Script Into Different Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
* Explore Selenium Locators (XPATH, CSS, ID, Name, ClassName, LinkText/Partial LinkText)
* Static Drop Using Select Class For Select Tag(By Index, By Visible Text, By Value)
* Handle Dynamic Dropdown Using Loop & Elements
* Fetch Text & Attribute Value For Assertion
* Handle Dynamic Checkbox(By Loop, By Index) & Validate
* Assert is_selected, is_displayed
* Handling Alerts(Switch Alert Mode, Accept.Dismiss,Grab Text)
* Explicit & Implicit Wait(Using WebDriverWait For Explicit Wait)
* Chaining Web Element
* Functional Testing with GREEN-KART Site(Add To Cart, Validate Sum & Discount, Matching Prod Names List)
* Actions (Click & Hold, Contex CLick, Double Click, Long-press, Drag & Drop, Hover) Using ActionChains
* Handling Windows(Switch/Back Window Mode To Child/Parent By Index)
* Functional Testing with login-pagePractise Site(Parent/ChildWindow Handle, Email Extract, Explicit Wait & Assert)
* iFrame Handle, switch to frame. Go to default mode
* Execute JavaScript, Added Chrome Argument(headless, handle ssl certificate etc)
* Table Sorting & Validation, Chrome Options Details Explore
* E2E Functional Testing (AngularPractice Shop)[All Topics Included]

## Selenium Python Framework Design Plan

* Pytest Unit Testing Framework
  * pytest file should start with test_ or end with _test
  * pytest method names should start with test & any code wrapped in method only. Every method behave like one test case.
  * run ``py.test -v -s`` to run all test cases in a directory. v=verbose,s=console log
  * 
* Understand Logging and HTML Reports
* Implement Selenium Python Framework (PageObject DesignPattern)
* Integrating Framework to Jenkins and setup job parameters
* Data Driven Framework with Excel to Selenium Python Tests

### Miscellaneous

* GIT Version Control
